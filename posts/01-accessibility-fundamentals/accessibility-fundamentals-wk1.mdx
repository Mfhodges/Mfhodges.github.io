I am studying for the [Web Accessibility Specialist](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/wascertification) 
certification by the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP).

Every week I will be studying independently and then reveiwing the content for the week with some of my colleagues.

I thought it would be easiest if I use this blog to document this knowledge.

This week we are reviewing 'Introductory Materials' to web accessibilty which consists of disabilities, guidelines, and Laws.
