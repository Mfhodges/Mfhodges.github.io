This is my first post!


I was able to create this site by following Jason Lengstorf's [Introduction to Gatsby Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/gatsby/). 
In this course I learned how to:
- use GraphQL in Gatsby for storing and retreiving data, 
- create pages and posts with MDX
- optimize images automatically with gatsby-image
- and how to load 3rd party data into components

very cool!!
