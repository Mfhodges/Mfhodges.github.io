This is my first post! SICK 🛹💥🐓


I was able to create this site by following Jason Lengstorf's [Introduction to Gatsby Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/gatsby/). 
In this course I learned how to:
- use GraphQL in Gatsby for storing and retreiving data 
- create pages and posts with MDX
- optimize images automatically with gatsby-image
- and how to load 3rd party data into components

very cool 🤙!! 

I am hosting this static site on Netlify which means that I do not need to use Cloudflare. For more information about this check out this doc: [Why You Don't Need Cloudflare with Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/03/28/why-you-dont-need-cloudflare-with-netlify/).
