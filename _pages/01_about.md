Hi, I'm Maddy! I'm a web developer from Philadelphia. I currently work as Courseware Developer for the University of Pennsylvania in the Teaching, Research and Learning Services department within the Van Pelt Library.

I started this website to help me better document things I am learning and to house projects I'm working on.
