## ðŸ”§ This article is still under development ðŸ”§

In this tutorial you will gain an understanding of how static site generators like Jekyll function so you can more confidentially understand Jekyll tutorials and edit/build your own static site.


##### By the end of this tutorial you should feel comfortable explaining to a friend:
- static site
- dynamic site
- Jekyll
- templating engine
- tba


### Interacting with Static/Dynamic Sites

For those of you who appreciate a good diagram (you have come to the right post ðŸ˜‰) here is  how users access/interact with a website based on it's type (static v. dynamic). Each computation needed to show the webpage is depicted by arrows which are labeled chronologically.

#### Static Site
<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
    A["fa:fa-laptop User Request"]
    B["fa:fa-server Server"]
    A-->|1| B;
    B-->|2| A;
</div>

Files are served ( and cached ) immediately on request. No additional work - no DB queries or templating engine used.  

**Static Site Examples**
- This page you are reading! ( which was generated with Jekyll )
- add another example


#### Dynamic Site
<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
    A["fa:fa-laptop User Request"]
    B["fa:fa-server Server"]
    C["fa:fa-database DB"]
    D["&#123&#123 &#125&#125 Templating Engine"]
    A-->|1| B;
    B-->|4| A;
    B-->|2| C;
    B-->|3| D;
</div>
If the term templating engine is confusing hold off till later in this post where it is explained.

**Dynamic Site Examples**
- Django Web Apps
- Any WordPress Site ( or any database-driven CMS)
- link to a website




#### So What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a static site generator that runs on the Ruby programming language. You don't need to know *any* ruby to create a site generated by Jekyll but, if you want to make a lot of customizations, knowledge of ruby will be needed.

Moreover, Jekyll compiles/generates a static site from a predefined file structure. This file structure provides a way to
 break up bits of html and markdown into logical units and then assemble them into a single html page. In the following sections I will describe how these little bits fit together to create a static html document/page.



#### How a Jekyll Page is Created

In the `_layouts/` directory you define the templates of your different webpage types ( e.g. the general page structure, blog post, a page).



**default.html**
```
{% raw %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
{% include head.html %}

<body class="light-mode">

	{% include header.html %}
	<main id="main-content">
		<article class="container">
			{{ content }}
		</article>

	</main>
	{% include footer.html %}
</body>
{% endraw %}
```

This code block should look pretty familiar to all the important stuff in an html page
albeit an essentially blank page.

The  `%}` and `{}` are liquid tags. These are the bread and butter of most templating engines. These tags say go get this content.
**Explain templating engine**

Templates (defined in `_layouts`) can inherit from other templates in the `_layouts` folder. If you take a look at the first few lines of page.html, you see that the page.html template extends the default.html template. In Jekyll think of the terms layout and template as interchangable.


##### Here are the first few lines of page.html
```
---
layout: page
title: About me
permalink: /about/
---
```

Text like this does some defining for how these pieces fit together. `layout` defines which template this file is extending. `permalink` defines where this file will go in the `_sites` folder.


##### Generating My About Me Page
Below is my best attempt to show how these bits are put together to create a full html document.

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
subgraph  &#95;includes/
  A["fa:fa-file head.html"]
  B["fa:fa-file header.html"]
  C["fa:fa-file footer.html"]
end


subgraph  &#95;layouts/

  subgraph default.html
      D1["&#123;% include head.html %&#125;"]
      D2["&#123;% include header.html %&#125;"]
      D3["&#123;&#123; content &#125;&#125;"]
      D4["&#123;% include footer.html %&#125;"]
  end

  subgraph page.html
      E1["&#123;&#123; page.title &#125;&#125;"]
      E2["&#123;&#123; content &#125;&#125;"]
  end
end

subgraph  &#95;pages/
  G["fa:fa-file 01_about.md"]
end

subgraph  &#95;site/about/
  H["fa:fa-file index.html"]
end


G-->E1
G-->E2
E1-->D3
E2-->D3

A-->D1
B-->D2
C-->D4

D1-->H
D2-->H
D3-->H
D4-->H
</div>


So when you are running the command `jekyll serve` you are not just starting a local host server but, you are actually asking your computer to take all of these bits and put them together in the structure you( or your theme ) have defined.




#### How Sass works
Think of Sass as a Jekyll generator for your CSS file. It works in a a similar way where you keep all of your variables in one place and then have your template in another. These files are then compiled/built into one main.css. The nice thing about using sass is really with colors; if you say `$blue = #somehex code`, you don't have to remember that hex code just use `$blue` instead!
